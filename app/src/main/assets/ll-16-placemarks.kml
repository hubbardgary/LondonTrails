    <name>A1 Crossing</name>
    <description><![CDATA[The worst feature of the London Loop due to the amount of road walking required to cross it, the A1 is at least interesting in that, at 410 miles, its the longest numbered road in the UK. It connects the capital of England with the capital of Scotland. It was designated by the Ministry of Transport in 1921 and largely follows the route of the old Great North Road.]]></description>
