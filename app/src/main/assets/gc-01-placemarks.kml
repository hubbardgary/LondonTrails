    <name>Thamesmead Estate</name>
    <description><![CDATA[Thamesmead was conceived as a new town by the Greater London Council in the mid 1960s, intended to house 60,000 people and provide large areas of parkland and lakes. Due to financial constraints, the construction deviated from the original plan, and has been described as bearing "little resemblance to the ideal community" envisaged by the original designers. Development of the area is still ongoing.]]></description>

    <name>Lesnes Abbey ruins</name>
    <description>Lesnes Abbey dates back to 1178. It was one of the first monasteries to be shut down as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries Act in 1534, at which point many of the buildings were demolished. London County Council bought the site in 1930, and it was opened to the public as parkland the following year.</description>
