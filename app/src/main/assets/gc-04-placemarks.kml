    <name>Shooters Hill</name>
    <description>Depending on who you believe, Shooters Hill takes its name from archers using the area for practice during Medieval (is Medieval the same as middle ages?) times, its reputation as a favoured location for highwaymen, or the fact that a number of anti-aircraft guns were stationed here during the Second World War. It is the highest point in the Borough of Greenwich.</description>
