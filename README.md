# London Trails 
### Discover a hidden side of London!
London Trails is an Android app that plots some of London's walking routes on a GPS enabled map allowing you to follow your progress against them. It also contains a wealth of information about points of interest you will encounter on each walk.

The routes are designed to encourage you away from the bustling hot spots of the big city and into the more tranquil, lesser known areas of the capital. These walks take in a surprisingly green side of the sprawling suburbs that you might not otherwise experience.

London Trails caters for all abilities and levels of fitness by allowing you to tailor the start and end points, and therefore the distance, of each route.

Get it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hubbardgary.londontrails "Get London Trails!")!
