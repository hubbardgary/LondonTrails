	<name>Lesnes Abbey ruins</name>
	<description>Lesnes Abbey dates back to 1178. It was one of the first monasteries to be shut down as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries Act in 1534, at which point many of the buildings were demolished. London County Council bought the site in 1930, and it was opened to the public as parkland the following year.</description>
